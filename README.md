# CloudGoat Sumo Logic Detection Labs

This repository contains two complete labs built with AWS CloudGoat to demonstrate attackâ€‘toâ€‘detection workflows using Sumo Logic.

## Included Labs

| Lab | Purpose |
|---|---------|
| `iam_privesc_by_attachment` | Demonstrates IAM privilege escalation via AttachUserPolicy & CreateAccessKey. |
| `rce_web_app` | Demonstrates Remote Code Execution and EC2 exploitation in a web app. |

## Contents of Each Lab

Each lab directory contains:

- `dashboards/` â€” JSON exports of dashboards showing detection panels  
- `queries/` â€” Working detection queries  
- `logs/` â€” Sample raw CloudTrail logs supporting detections  
- `screenshots/` â€” Visual evidence of detections  
- `README.md` â€” Labâ€‘specific instructions and narrative 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Simulate realistic AWS attacks in a controlled lab
- Capture logs using CloudTrail, ELB, and S3 logging
- Build detection queries and visual dashboards in Sumo Logic
- Validate the end-to-end kill chain from exploit â†’ exfiltration â†’ alerting

## ðŸ›  Setup Requirements

- AWS account (tested in `us-east-1`)
- CloudTrail enabled + log delivery to S3
- Sumo Logic trial account with CloudTrail log source
- [CloudGoat v3.1.0](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat) and AWS CLI

See each labâ€™s README for specific attack details and detection logic.
