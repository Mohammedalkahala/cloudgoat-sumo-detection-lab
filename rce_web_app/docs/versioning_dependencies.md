## âœ… Version Pinning

You should pin the following versions in config files to ensure reproducibility:

**Terraform example:**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 4.0.0"
    }
    sumologic = {
      source  = "SumoLogic/sumologic"
      version = ">= 2.14.0"
    }
  }
}
